# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Grafonnet! We welcome all people
who want to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our
community. Grafonnet is developed within the Grafana community. Therefore we
are following the same [Code of Conduct as
Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). To
help us create a safe and positive community experience for all, we require all
participants to adhere to it.

## Plugin Scope

**Grafonnet only aims to support official plugins.**

We've drawn this line to ensure that the code base stays focused and manageable
over time. We do, however, encourage development and use of community Grafonnet
plugins. See the [Community
Plugins](https://grafana.github.io/grafonnet-lib/community-plugins/) page for
more info on this.

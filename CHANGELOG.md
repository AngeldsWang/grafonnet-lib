## 0.0.1 (2020-07-06)

The project is almost 3 years old and this is the first official release.

Historically, users have targeted a specific commit for their personal and
organization's usage. Today, we're creating the first "official" release for
folks to optionally target. This marks a small step in carrying out plans for
making Grafonnet more accessible to our community and improving compatibility.
